I began to work on the basic html layout, implementing bootstrap api and basic elements like some css and the navbar.
I created the files, file structure and did the js for the form. I just laid the functional fundamentals for the website for the extra css touches to be added.

I worked on the css and styled all the pages and added additional touches to the website.
I used bootstrap to make each page responsive so it looks good on all screen sizes.

I did the Menu page and touched up the main index page in relation to the location of other stores and eircodes.
I updated all the menu items with links to wikipedia or other information sites.
